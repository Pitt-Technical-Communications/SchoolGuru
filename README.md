                  ## Usage

                  ### Basic Usage

                  After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

                  ### Advanced Usage

                  After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

                  You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.

## Document Intentions
    The purpose of this document is to help students effectively organize their time so they can complete all of their tasks. Instead of being forced to pull an all nighter for a big midterm, the planner will break up the study times throughout the week. After we have submitted our final version of the document, we have hopes that students in the future can help build onto this program to make it the best version of our idea possible.
